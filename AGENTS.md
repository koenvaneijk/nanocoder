## Caveats

When making changes to nanocoder, never put tags in full in your edits, use formatted strings and replace the tag text like in `nanocoder.py`, otherwise your edits will fail and break the code.

## Special notes

Always check coverage with `python3 test_nanocoder.py --coverage` after making edits to `nanocoder.py`.
